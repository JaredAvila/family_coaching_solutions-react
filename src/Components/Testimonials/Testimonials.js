          "Over two years ago I asked family and friends if they knew of a good Christian counselor. I am so delighted that they told me about Jay. From the moment I walked into his office Jay created a welcoming and safe environment where I felt I could be vulnerable and honest about my issues while I learned and grew along my journey. Jay listens intently and has the ability to ask the right questions or helps me see situations fro a different perspective that allows me to find solace and understanding throughout my growth. My relationship with Christ has grown as a result of our conversations and I cannot thank him enough for all he continued to do for me. Jay in an outstanding counselor. He is down to earth, realistic, loves God and has a passion for helping others.",

I have gone to see Jay to help me work through a period in my life where I had a child making poor choices and I needed help with how to work through this.  I have also seen Jay when I was dealing with a time of fear and anxiety.  It was very helpful to talk to him.  I left our sessions with a plan that gave me peace that I could do something positive about the situation and not be stuck in the worry and fear.  Thanks Jay!",
